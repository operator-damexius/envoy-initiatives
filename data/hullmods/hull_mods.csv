Doctrine Dex,nexdex,1,1,Envoy,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.Nexdex,"This ship is a survivor of the original Doctrines that founded the Hegemony. It is a prime specimen of the Domain Navy's ""decisive battle"" doctrine, particularly exhibited through a series of radical structural modifications performed with pre-Collapse industrial methods. These modifications allow for the mounting of high polarized armor, resulting in no reduction in speed and maneuverability. Exceptionally well-tuned energy systems enhance flux throughput and capacity beyond that of standard examples of this hull.
