envoy,FACTION,"The Envoy Initiatives is an alliance formed to counter the domination of both the Hegemony and the Persean League within the Sector. Comprising member planets such as Nimoria and Vesperis, this coalition acknowledges that its members may not always see eye to eye on various issues, which can lead to internal conflicts. Nevertheless, they stand united in their opposition to the Hegemony, which they perceive as illegitimately enforcing martial law under the banner of the now-defunct Domain.

Established in response to the escalating threats from both the Hegemony and the Persean League, the Envoy Initiatives aims to ensure that its member worlds retain their autonomy and can govern their internal affairs free from external interference.

The Envoy Initiatives embodies a complex political landscape where solidarity against common adversaries coexists with significant internal discord and diverse governance structures among its members. Its formation signifies a crucial shift in the Sector's power dynamics, reflecting ongoing struggles for autonomy and legitimacy in a post-Domain era.",,,,
